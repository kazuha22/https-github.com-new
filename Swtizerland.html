            <h1 class="H">HISTORY</h1>
          
            <p class="L">Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation,<br>
               is a landlocked country located at the confluence of Western, 
               Central and Southern Europe. It is bordered by Italy to the south, 
               France to the west, Germany to the north and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. 
               Switzerland is geographically divided among the Swiss Plateau, the Alps and the Jura;
                the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, whereas most of the country's population
                 of 9 million are concentrated on the plateau, which hosts the largest cities and economic 
                 centres, including Zürich, Geneva and Basel.</p>
                 <p class="L">The earliest known tribes formed the Hallstatt a
                  nd La Tène cultures, named after the archaeological site of La Tène on the north side of 
                  Lake Neuchâtel. La Tène culture developed and flourished during the late Iron Age from around 450 BC,
                  possibly influenced by Greek and Etruscan civilisations. One of the most important tribal groups was the 
                  Helvetii. Steadily harassed by Germanic tribes, in 58 BC, the Helvetii decided to abandon the Swiss 
                  Plateau and migrate to western Gallia. Julius Caesar's armies pursued and defeated them at the Battle of 
                  Bibracte, in today's eastern France, forcing the tribe to move back to its homeland. In 15 BC, Tiberius (later the second Roman emperor) 
                  and his brother Drusus conquered the Alps, integrating them into the Roman Empire. The area occupied by the Helvetii first became part of 
                  Rome's Gallia Belgica 
                  province and then of its Germania Superior province. The eastern portion of modern Switzerland was integrated into the Roman province 
                  of Raetia. Sometime around the start 
                  of the Common Era,
                   the Romans maintained a large camp called Vindonissa,
                   now a ruin at the confluence of the Aare and Reuss rivers, near the town of Windisch.</p>

                   <p class="L">The first and second century AD was an age of prosperity on the Swiss Plateau. Towns such as Aventicum, Iulia Equestris and Augusta Raurica, reached a remarkable size, while hundreds of agricultural estates (Villae rusticae) were established in the countryside.[citation needed]

                    Around 260 AD, the fall of the Agri Decumates territory north of the Rhine transformed today's Switzerland into a frontier land of the Empire.
                     Repeated raids by the Alamanni tribes provoked the ruin of the Roman towns and economy, forcing the population to shelter near Roman fortresses, 
                     like the Castrum Rauracense near Augusta Raurica. The Empire built another line of defence at the north border (the so-called Donau-Iller-Rhine-Limes).
                      At the end of the fourth century, the increased Germanic 
                    pressure forced the Romans to abandon the linear defence concept. The Swiss Plateau was finally open to Germanic tribes.</p>

                    </div>
                    

                    <p class="L">In the Early Middle Ages, from the end of the fourth century, the western extent of modern-day Switzerland was part of 
                    the territory of the Kings of the Burgundians. The Alemanni settled the Swiss Plateau in the fifth century and the valleys of 
                    the Alps in the eighth century, forming Alemannia. Modern-day Switzerland was then divided between the kingdoms of Alemannia and Burgundy. The entire 
                    region became part of the expanding Frankish Empire in the sixth century, following Clovis I's victory over the Alemanni at Tolbiac in 504 AD, and later Frankish domination of the Burgundians.[37][38]

Throughout the rest of the sixth, seventh and eighth centuries, Swiss regions continued under Frankish hegemony (Merovingian and Carolingian dynasties) 
but after its extension under Charlemagne, the Frankish Empire was divided by the Treaty of Verdun in 843.[34] The territories of present-day Switzerland became 
divided into Middle Francia and East Francia until they were reunified under the Holy Roman Empire around 1000 AD.

By 1200, the Swiss Plateau comprised the dominions of the houses of Savoy, Zähringer, Habsburg, and Kyburg. Some regions (Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, 
later known as Waldstätten) were accorded the Imperial immediacy to grant the empire direct control over the mountain passes. With the extinction of its male line in 1263,
 the Kyburg dynasty fell in AD 1264. The Habsburgs under King Rudolph I (Holy Roman Emperor in 1273) laid claim to the Kyburg lands and annexed them, extending their territory 
 to the eastern Swiss Plateau.</p>

        <p class="L">The Federal Charter or Letter 
          of Alliance (German: Bundesbrief) is one of the earliest constitutional documents of Switzerland. 
          A treaty of alliance from 1291 between the cantons of Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden, the Charter is one of a series of 
          alliances from which the Old Swiss Confederacy emerged. In the 19th and 20th century, after the establishment of the Swiss 
          federal state, the Charter became the central founding document of Switzerland in the popular imagination.
  
          The Charter documents the Eternal Alliance of the League of the Three Forest Cantons 
          (German: Ewiger Bund der Drei Waldstätten), the union of three cantons in what is now central Switzerland. 
          It is dated to early August 1291, which in the 20th century inspired the date of Swiss National Day, 1 August. 
          Done in Latin, the Charter makes reference to a previous (lost or unwritten) pact. It is now exhibited at the Museum of 
          the Swiss Charters of Confederation in Schwyz.</p>

              <p class="L">Swiss culture is characterised by diversity, which is reflected in diverse traditional customs.
                 A region may be in some ways culturally connected to the neighbouring country that shares its language, 
                 all rooted in western European culture.The linguistically isolated Romansh culture in Graubünden in eastern 
                 Switzerland constitutes an exception. It survives only in the upper valleys of the Rhine and the Inn and strives to maintain
                  its rare linguistic tradition.

                Switzerland is home to notable contributors to literature, art, architecture, music and sciences. In addition, 
                the country attracted creatives during times of unrest or war. Some 1000 museums are found in the country.
                
                Among the most important cultural performances held annually are the Paléo Festival, Lucerne Festival, 
                the Montreux Jazz Festival,the Locarno International Film Festival and Art Basel.</p>

                      <p>played an essential role in shaping Swiss history and the Swiss national identity.[23][239]
                         Many alpine areas and ski resorts attract visitors for winter sports as well as hiking and mountain biking in summer. 
                         The quieter seasons are spring and autumn. A traditional pastoral culture predominates in many areas,
                         and small farms are omnipresent in rural areas. Folk art is nurtured in organisations across the country. Switzerland most 
                         directly in appears in music, dance, poetry, wood carving, and embroidery. The alphorn, a trumpet-like musical 
                        instrument made of wood has joined yodeling and the accordion as epitomes of traditional Swiss music</p>
